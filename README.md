# Look & Feel
It’s important thing for every website to have a CSS Because it’s used to set the style in web page . We started with the home page and added our CSS style to match the home page and make it more organized, Our first CSS was the navigation bar because it’s the important thing to do ,we put our logo Health Zone in the top left with bigger font and bold and  Home Page , Sport Supplements , Vitamins & Health , sports we did put them in the middle of the navigation bar , And we put two icons on the right one for the shopping cart and one for the log in page.

For the home page we added a photo and paragraph this is our model .To feel more comfortable with the colors we chose white for our primary color and it’s color gradient . For the item’s we organized them with contanier that contain them all and inside this container we listed our items. For the other HTML pages such as Sport Supplements , Vitamins & Health , Sports we did use the same CSS  Style to organize the items on our shop . The log in page we did another CSS style we want to make it more alive when someone try to log in or register.
